/* Task_15 .Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations.
You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.*/


//• Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
let guestNames : String[] = ["Sana", "Rameen", "Farah", "Shahzaib", "Aiza", "Reema"];

let cannotJoin: String = "Aiza";
console.log(cannotJoin + " " + "can't join us at Dinner Party due to emergency");

//• Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
let newGuest: String = "Manahel";
guestNames[guestNames.indexOf(cannotJoin)] = newGuest;
console.log(guestNames);


//• Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
guestNames.map((item)=>
        console.log(`Hey ${item}! You are Cordinally invited to a Dinner.`)
);
